# Little Backstory
After playing Minecraft for a long part of my life, I decided to get into plugin development as hopefully a new hobby of mine. I watched many video tutorials before starting and this is my first simple plugin I made myself.
This was a huge learning experience for me and I had a lot of fun having to test my implementations and fix problems like I would in a real world scenario. 
As a software engineering undergraduate, this was a great opportunity to apply myself to something related to my career aspirations.


# More Than Meets The Eye
### Yes I know, this is hardly something someone can be amazed at. I myself, was amazed. I decided to continue this project. I like the idea I had with player suggestions and I stuck with it. I am now currently developing (hopefully) a better, more improved version of SuggestionsPL... **SuggestionsX**! Feel free to check it out as it will remain open source on my git-hub for anybody to use, until futher notice :)
